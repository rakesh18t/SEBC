Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?

	Course was a real learning curve for. Very useful and i believe that it preapres an individual to think methodically, read care fully and follow instructions by the letter.

Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?
	Security and securing the environment

Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?
	Resource was very useful. should I have completed the Security topic, this would hve ranked as no.1.
	All topics were useful.

How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?
	I think I need atleast 3 ~ 5 weeks as I want to master all the topics covered in this course.
	I need to work on security, and also the more practice the more fluent the process becomes.

Thank you, Michael.
